# Strategic_Investment_Analysis
This project aims to meticulously analyze and compare various SPY (S&P 500 ETF) trading strategies using Python. The strategies under consideration include a simple buy-and-hold approach, intraday trading (buying at open and selling at close), overnight holding (buying at close and selling at open), and a modified buy-and-hold strategy that excludes the best and worst days of trading each year. Using real-world data, this analysis will highlight the performance, risks, and practical limitations of each strategy, providing a comprehensive guide on where to invest $10,000 in a taxable brokerage account. Through detailed calculations, visualizations, and discussions, the project will explore how these strategies could play out over time, considering transaction costs, market volatility, and timing risks.
